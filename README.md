# COVID-19 in Africa: Examining the Impact and Prevalence of the Disease

We aim to provide information about the COVID-19 virus, including its origins, symptoms, and treatment. Our project discusses the impact of the virus on different age groups and the measures taken to prevent its spread, including city-wide lockdowns and social distancing. Using Python, the authors analyze the differential conditions of the virus and create visualizations to demonstrate the impact of social distancing measures and city shutdowns. Our paper also examines the impact of lifting closures and relaxing social distancing measures after 100 days. Additionally, we provide insight into the expected trajectory of the disease in Africa, using a dataset of COVID-19 cases to demonstrate that the scale of the virus is relatively low in many African countries. Emphasizing the importance of continuing to monitor and address the ongoing threat of COVID-19.
