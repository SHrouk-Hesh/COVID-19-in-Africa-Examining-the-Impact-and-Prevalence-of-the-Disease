# COVID-19 in Africa: Examining the Impact and Prevalence of the Disease

We aim to provide information about the COVID-19 virus, including its origins, symptoms, and treatment. Our project discusses the impact of the virus on different age groups and the measures taken to prevent its spread, including city-wide lockdowns and social distancing. Using Python, the authors analyze the differential conditions of the virus and create visualizations to demonstrate the impact of social distancing measures and city shutdowns. Our paper also examines the impact of lifting closures and relaxing social distancing measures after 100 days. Additionally, we provide insight into the expected trajectory of the disease in Africa, using a dataset of COVID-19 cases to demonstrate that the scale of the virus is relatively low in many African countries. Emphasizing the importance of continuing to monitor and address the ongoing threat of COVID-19.

# Discussion & Conclusion 
First, we constructed a visualization show the dynamics in case of absence of any isolation, quarantine or closure measures, then we compare between age groups. After that, we talked about the effect of exercising social distancing in addition to the existing shutdowns, and the effect of lifting closures and relaxing social distancing after 100 days. Secondly, we conducted a predictive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.
Our results show that the scale of the pandemic is low across many countries in Africa. Many experts have debated the reason why fewer cases of COVID-19 are
being reported in Africa. Some have pointed toward the lack of widespread testing of COVID-19, whereas others point towards the African climate. We showed that, on average, most counties in Africa, including Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Benin, have reported fewer than 10,000 COVID-19 cases. Conversely, most European countries
have reported, on average more than 30,000 COVID-19 cases. Importantly, in most of the counties on the continent, our prediction shows that the number of COVID-19
cases reported in July 2020 are unlikely to be surpassed by those in the next few months. Furthermore, we predicted that COVID-19 pandemic would
disproportionately affect different countries in Africa. We expect that even the worst affected among these would report COVID-19 positive cases that are comparable to those other regions of the World. Interestingly, our model predictions were statistically significantly valid for only 18 of the 51 individual African countries for which we predicted the spread of the COVID19 pandemics. Therefore, we encourage everyone (including individuals in African countries) to adhere to the guidelines that are aimed at reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
